# Analytics on Spotify User Data
In this project I have done analytics on the Spotify Extended Streaming History data to find some listening statistics of the user. <br>
In the Spotify Extended Streaming History data each entry corresponds to a song/podcast being played along with the features as as listening time, artist name, album name, etc. Using this features it is possible to find various useful statistics from the data to understand the listening pattern of the user.

The favorite songs, albums and artists are determined by a score calculated by assigning appropriate weights to each feature.
